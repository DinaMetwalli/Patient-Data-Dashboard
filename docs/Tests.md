# Testing
## Running Your Tests
Since we're using pytest testing framework, in order to run your tests you could use the command `pytest path\to\test\file`. This will start a test session and show the output of your tests.

## Creating Test Files
Tests should be seperated into files for the respective feature being tested. For example if you're writing tests for the patient class, you could create a `test_patient.py` file in which you will write your unit tests. All test files should be created under the tests/ directory.
